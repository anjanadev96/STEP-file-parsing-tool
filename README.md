# **STEP-file-parsing-tool**

##Some Info about the tool use


###This repository is written for the parsing of .STEP files in the ABC Dataset. 
Each .STEP file is a collection of Compounds or Solids, which are in turn composed of Faces, and Trimmed Curves.
The main_par file is written for processing 1 million .step files from the ABC Dataset in parallel.
Separate files have been included for Non-Uniform Rational Bsplines and other primitives.
